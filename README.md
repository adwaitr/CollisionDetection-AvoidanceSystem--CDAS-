# CollisionDetection-AvoidanceSystem--CDAS-
Collision Detection and Avoidance System is presented as a solution that helps to detect collisions using an Ultrasonic sensor. This sensor is used to detect collisions by measuring the distance from colliding object to sensor, if the distance is greater than the assigned value then the system identifies there is an impending collision and alerts the user of a collision.
The project incorporates a safe-distance LED, a warning buzzer and Piezo Sensor to warn the driver to apply brakes when there is an impending collision. Collision detection is the computational problem of detecting the intersection of two or more objects. Collision detection is a classic issue of computational geometry and has applications in various computing fields, primarily in computer graphics, computer games, computer simulations, robotics and computational physics. <br>
