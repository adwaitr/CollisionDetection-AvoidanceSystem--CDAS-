# CollisionDetection-AvoidanceSystem--CDAS-
Collision Detection and Avoidance System is presented as a solution that helps to detect collisions using Ultrasonic sensor. This sensor is used to detect collisions by measuring the distance from colliding object to sensor, if the distance is greater than assigned value then system identifies there is an impending collision and alerts the user of a collision. We have also incorporated a safe-distance LED, a warning buzzer and Piezo Sensor to warn driver to apply brakes when there is an impeding collision. Collision detection is the computational problem of detecting the intersection of two or more objects. Collision detection is a classic issue of computational geometry and has applications in various computing fields, primarily in computer graphics, computer games, computer simulations, robotics and computational physics.
